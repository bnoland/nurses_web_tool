\section*{Introduction}

This web tool allows you to explore trends in union membership and union
contract coverage for registered nurses in the United States. You can use the
tool to generate trend plots and chloropleth maps showing how these quantities
change over time, filtered and/or grouped according to a variety of demographics
(detailed below). The tool uses data derived from the Current Population Survey
(CPS) public use microdata. For background information on the CPS, see [ADD
REFERENCE].

\section*{Details of the data}

The tool operates on data derived from the Current Population Survey (CPS)
public use microdata (see [ADD REFERENCE] for information on the raw CPS data).
Each entry in the data used by the tool corresponds to an individual interviewed
as part of the CPS, and includes various demographic data on that individual, as
well as flags indicating whether the individual is a union member or covered by
a union contract. Each entry also includes the year in which the individual was
interviewed, and a statistical weight used to calculate union membership and
union contract coverage proportions.

The following are descriptions of the variables in the data used by the tool,
including the possible values or levels that a particular variable can assume:
\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm,font=\normalfont]
\item[\texttt{year}] The year the individual was interviewed.

\item[\texttt{sex}] The individual's sex. This is derived from the CPS variable
\texttt{PESEX}.

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{Male}, \texttt{Female}

\item[\texttt{member}] Union membership flag. \texttt{TRUE} if the individual is
a union member, and \texttt{FALSE} otherwise.

\item[\texttt{covered}] Union contract coverage flag. \texttt{TRUE} if the
individual is covered by a union contract, and \texttt{FALSE} otherwise.

\item[\texttt{age}] The individual's age. This is derived from the CPS variable
\texttt{PEAGE} or, if that is unavailable, the CPS variable \texttt{PRTAGE}.

\item[\texttt{age\_group}] The individual's age group (16-24, 25-54, or 55 and
over). This is derived from \texttt{age}.

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{16-24}, \texttt{25-54}, \texttt{55 and over}

\item[\texttt{race}] The individual's race. This is derived from the CPS
variable \texttt{PTDTRACE}. It has levels for some of the more common races, and
a level \texttt{Other} for other races. The levels of this variable are less
fine-grained than those of \texttt{PTDTRACE} (see the CPS documentation for
details).

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{White}, \texttt{Black}, \texttt{American Indian
(Alaskan Native)}, \texttt{Asian}, \texttt{Hawaiian/Pacific Islander},
\texttt{Other}

\item[\texttt{hisp}] Whether or not the individual is Hispanic. This is derived
from the CPS variable \texttt{PEHSPNON}.

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{Hispanic}, \texttt{Non-Hispanic}

\item[\texttt{educ}] The individual's level of education. This is derived from
the CPS variable \texttt{PEEDUCA}. The levels of this variable are less
fine-grained than those of \texttt{PEEDUCA} (see the CPS documentation for
details).

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{No high school}, \texttt{Completed high school},
\texttt{Some college}, \texttt{Associate degree}, \texttt{Bachelor's degree},
\texttt{Graduate degree}

\item[\texttt{citizen}] The individual's US citizenship status. This is derived
from the CPS variable \texttt{PRCITSHP}. The levels of this variable are less
fine-grained than those of \texttt{PRCITSHP} (see the CPS documentation for
details).

\textbf{Levels:} \texttt{US native}; \texttt{Foreign-born}, \texttt{citizen};
\texttt{Foreign-born}, \texttt{non-citizen}

\item[\texttt{state}] The US state (including DC) where the individual resides.
This is derived from the CPS variable \texttt{GESTFIPS}.

\textbf{Levels:} (The two letter abbreviations for each of the 50 states,
including DC)

\item[\texttt{weight}] Statistical weight. Used to calculate union membership
and union contract coverage proportions.
